contract SafeMath - mathematics with overflow checks
contract Token - abstract ERC20 token
contract StandardToken - default realization of ERC20 token
contract LATToken - realization of ERC20-based LAT Token
contract ExchangeContract - contract-helper to support exchanging old tokens to the new ones (if it will be needed in future)

1. Send 400 000 000 of LAT tokens to the company wallet on the Token Sale ending
2. Starting from 22.08.2022 smart contract will everyday send 328Â 767 LAT to the company wallet in next 5 years. It will send 600 000 000 tokens in total.
